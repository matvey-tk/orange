                                In New Zealand, some companies use drone technology to help scan the terrain data.

                                We found that these companies are booked out, working every day to do this terrain scanning. It can be hard to book a day and then the results can take significant time too.

                                The "Rules, standards and guidelines" section of the LINZ government NZ website states that for data to be deemed valid it has to be comparable to LINZ data.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                As a secondary vital rule to our investigation, the rules state that any utility-related data has to be accurate for future needs.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We found these two rules both give a positive and negative position to incorporating more technology to help speed this process up.

                                LINZ is a database of New Zealand terrain and imagery information. If it is being used as a standard to regulate surverying this means it can be used for estimates or even approval of land use.

                                Since the current standard procedure is using it as validation rather than the database for consent then it adds a layer of protection from bad data. So even though the data is there, there is a barrier of uncertainty from utilizing it fully.

                                Having discussed the barrier of using LINZ data at face value for consent, we still believe there is a big gap between what the current situation could be vs reality.

                                If there is a resource available for error checking private organizations that do this surveying then there could be a system that does fast cost-effective estimates for interested parties.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We also believe if bad data is truly the concern then putting in funds to have error-checked and updated data for popular building regions could then allow for this system to quickly provide the survey details and speed up huge amounts of work.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We did however discover the need for accurate data about specific things, but we believe this doesn't directly conflict with our idea. We think it just means most of the surveying in those situations can be automatic through the global data and then additional data that is relevant to the parts that need absolute accuracy get that attention to detail.

                            <p>
                                When looking at the possible reasons an old business resists changing to a modern eco-system we believe there are many levels of barriers.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We can look at:
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>People nearing retirement</li>
                                <li>User mistakes causing security problems</li>
                                <li>Backwards compatability</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The reality of someone who's worked most of their life doing their work in a certain way is that they'll avoid having to relearn their job when they are near retirement. To them, understandably this is a waste of their time.
                                Forcing a generation of employees out of work because technology moves fast and they can't keep up would be a form of ageism.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                If we try to address the problem of international signatures by using e-signatures we can find it is a similar problem of people being inexperienced, these people would be at the greatest risk of cybercrimes.
                                Implementing a new technological eco-system would stop cybercriminal targetted attacks but would raise the complexity of doing daily business for these employees. They would be a huge risk of making a mistake and compromising the system.

                                Backwards compatibility is how you look at something new being implemented affecting the past functionality of a system, in this case, an office. How would implementing a modern ecosystem impact business that was done in the past?
                                In the case of implementing better ways to track correspondence, keep copies of data and find old records we found there would be a large problem of dealing with old data. It would take a very long time for older businesses to bring their data online and properly indexed to filter.
                                This would make them have to not only learn a new system, but they would have to use both systems at the same time for day business would harm their work.

                                Currently, a lot of businesses utilize external IT companies to provide them security solutions without even implementing new systems to aid their business.
                                We believe these small older offices choose their companies because they are unaware of what is good and bad and end up picking the most expensive solution thinking it is best for them.

                                For a small business with a simple set of operations, a complicated expensive solution will only make doing day business difficult and raise the risk of user error.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We recommend these offices look for small IT companies that assist rather than pre-prepared packages for them. We believe it isn't expensive to set up a good ecosystem that won't harm their daily business.

                            Education is slowly using more technology in teaching their subjects, helping their students study and providing assistance.
                            After investigating the many barriers technology faces in utilizing it more we believe it shouldn't rush to implement it all around.

                                Education however seems to be quite scatted in this, some subjects utilize it and some avoid it entirely.
                                We have also found it differs between what age groups are studying.

                            <p>
                                Education is a broad problem, so we'll avoid looking at specific areas of it but instead more wide-range barriers.
                                We believe there are many that range from economic, ethical and a lack of seeing long term results.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                Schools are found in all ranges of demographics where it can be a luxury to have modern devices. 
                                For those cases, it is understandably out of the question to implement these modern solutions.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We have found there is a big ethical question of applying technology, especially at high implementation levels could negatively affect students in the long term.
                                Research is being done globally on the impact of technology on students, many find there are good and bad parts to it but to see results we have to wait many years.
                                This raises an ethical dilemma where experimenting with student lives is not alright but at the same time, we cannot prove results without the experimentation.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We believe schools are implementing technology at slow rates and few subjects at a time so they can property judge if the impact is overall positive.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                There is also a less touched on a section of technology in schools which is the teachers have to be very capable with using it.
                                With older generations, we face similar problems as the small offices where people nearing retirement will resist having to relearn their jobs and on top of that the security
                                problems that could arise from making mistakes.
                            </p>

                                Possible Solutions

                            <p>
                                For education, we believe technology is being utilized at its capacity when considering the ethical barriers.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                To say we should fully re-invest a system that affects the future generations without slowly making sure the impacts are positive would be wrong.
