                            <p>
                                Land surveying is the process of mapping 3-dimensional points on terrain to construct topography information. It is a vital step of preperation in construction planning and building concent.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                In New Zealand, some companies use drone technology to help scan the terrain data.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We found that these companies are booked out, working every day to do this terrain scanning. It can be hard to book a day and then the results can take significant time too.
                            </p>

                            <div class="case-heading">
                                Barriers
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                The "Rules, standards and guidelines" section of the linz government NZ website states that for data to be deemed valid it has to be comparable to LINZ data.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                As a secondary vital rule to our investigation, the rules state that any utility related data has to be accurate for future needs.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We found these two rules both give a positive and negative position to incorporating more technology to help speed this process up.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                LINZ is a database of New Zealand terrain and imagery information. If it is being used as a standard to regulate surverying this means it can be used for estimates or even approval of land use. We believe such a system poses an ethical threat where if we rely on a database that does general scanning instead of a case-by-case basis then there can be huge room for bad data leading to incorrectly placed concent.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                Since the current standard procedure is using it as validation rather than the database for concent then it adds a layer of protection from bad data. So even though the data is there, there is a barrier of uncertainty from utilizing it fully.
                            </p>

                            <div class="case-heading">
                                Possible Solutions
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                Having discussed the barrier of using LINZ data at face value for consent, we still believe there is big gap between what the current situation could be vs reality.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                If there is a resource available for error checking private organizations that do this surveying then there could be a system that does fast cost effective estimates for interested parties.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We also believe if bad data is truly the concern then putting in funds to have error-checked and updated data for popular building regions could then allow for this system to quickly provide the survey details and speed up huge amounts of work.
                                <br><br><span class="-sg-margin-b"></span>
                                We did however discover the need for accurate data about specific things, but we believe this doesn't directly conflict with our idea. We think it just means most of the surverying in those situations can be automatic through the global data and then additional data that is relevant to the parts that need absolute accuracy get that attention to detail.
